# RussianLuckyTicket


#Though electronic systems are beginning to take over in public transport, the old so-thin-it-disintegrates-in-the-heat brown paper tickets are still prevalent in Russia. They come on roll-like raffle tickets, and the bus conductor, depending on your bus and city, either hangs them from a loop, or distributes them by hand. Ticket numbers range from 000000 to 999999. 

#Some of these tickets are lucky. If the first three and last three numbers add up to the same sum, the ticket is lucky. 



#This was borrowed from an NYU blog post, cheers. Didn't feel like typing the entire thing.
